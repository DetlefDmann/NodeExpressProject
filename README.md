# NodeExpressProject

## Make a simple backend

For a previous project. I needed a back-end and used a simple external API.
When doing another private project I realised that I should not use someone elses backend if I want to store user-data.
I am therefore trying to learn it for myself.
Since I already know JavaScript , Node and Express seem the obvious tools.

## Use ES6 syntax for importing/exporting

Jest and Node seem to have problems using ES6 syntax. Some changes in the package.json file should do the trick...
Link to relevant info from [Sam Meechward](https://sammeechward.com/jest-and-esmodules/) and Jest [website](https://jestjs.io/docs/ecmascript-modules).
For insight into the difference between Common JS modules and ES6 modules, I found [this website](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/03/es-modules-a-cartoon-deep-dive/) enlightening.

## Start with a todo-list app

As a starter I am going to set the server up for a todo-list app.
I will use TDD with Jest, so I need to examine how to use Jest with a node/express app and how to test a server.

## Jest and Supertest

I came across a few videos that use a combination of Jest and Supertest.
