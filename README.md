## make a simple backend

For a previous project I needed a back-end and used a simple external API.
When doing another private project I realised that I should not use someone elses backend if I want to store user-data.
I am therefore trying to learn it for myself. Since I already know JavaScript , Node and Express seem the obvious tools.
