## make a simple backend

For a previous project I needed a back-end and used a simple external API.

I am therefore trying to learn it for myself. Since I already know JavaScript , Node and Express seem the obvious tools.

## Jest and Supertest

I came across a few videos that use a combination of Jest and Supertest.
